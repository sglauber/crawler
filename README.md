# Basic Usage

1. Clone the repot to your machine
2. Make sure that you have nodejs installed
3. On the project folder run `npm install`
4. Call `node` pointing to `main.js` and pass a URL to it

# Example
`node main.js https://www.example.com/`

# Limitations
1. It'll take a long time to run on websites like stackoverflow and at somepoint it'll get a `429 - Too many requests` exception but it works :).
2. It doesn't handle links of external domains
3. Probably many others...
